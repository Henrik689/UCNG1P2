During the design process of the project  we have learned how the different parts of the surveillance system works.\newline
Through the project description a specification of requirements has been made. With the requirements specified an example of a server room was made (\ref{sensorplacement}).\newline 
A block diagram of the hardware architecture was made with the subsystems further explained.
A software flowchart has been made in order to to display the functionality of the system. This is done to show the different pathways, the program is able to take throughout the code.\newline
Furthermore we have calculated a total price for designing and developing a functional product.
