In the following section the hardware structure and functionality will be described. The focus point of this section is the variety of hardware needed and their functions within the surveillance system. Furthermore the hardware requirements will be specified followed by an in depth description of the different parameters used. This is followed by a bill of materials and a calculation of the price.
\section{Specification of hardware requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[•]Real time controller
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[-]The real time controller is chosen for the use of precise and continuous logging.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item[•]Data storing (SD-card)
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[-]For storing data from the different measurements that have been made by the entire sensor package.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item[•]Redundant power supply with UPS backup
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[-]For safety measures and reliability a redundant setup with UPS backup is chosen. This guarantees and maximize the uptime of the system.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item[•]Rack- and wall mountable
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[-]Easy compatible instalment
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
